# Enhancing-RUL-Prediction-for-Multi-Sensor-Equipment-with-a-Sequence-Feature-Attention-Mechanism

This is the code of the paper "Enhancing Remaining Useful Life Prediction for Multi-Sensor Equipment with a Sequence-Feature Attention Mechanism".

## Instructions:
* Step1 Run ./Transformer_pre.py to get the pre-training model proposed in this paper.The variable "sub_dataset" can be used to specify the dataset for Pre-training

* Step2 Run ./Transformer_ft_serialatten.py to fine tune the model.
